# news-dashboard

***Code is in the "master" branch. That was a bit of a mishap while pushing from VS, but I will it leave there for now, since I plan on developing the project further.***

This is a news dashboard app created using winforms on .NET. It features picture boxes on the main menu (and their corresponding buttons on the left menu) that represent different news categories. Content for the news categories is retrieved from https://newsapi.org/.

This is my first real solo project, meaning - the first project that's entirely my idea and not an assignment from a class or tutorial. So I'm quite pleased with it. I feel like it got me over a certain hump. I looking forward to developing it further.
